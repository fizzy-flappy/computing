Fireworks by Katy Perry (lyrics edit)

Do you ever feel just like a piece of trash

Drifting trough your ife

Wanting to change it all


Do you ever feel there's no point in life

Like a house of sticks

One blow from collapsing


Do you ever feel like no one understands

All you say and do

Yet no one seems to get a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you

There's still hope in you


You just have to find your hope

And brighten yourself

Just find the one

That can light up your life


Cause you are stuck in darkness

You can't find the light you need

And here's the light oh- oh- oh-

You're gonna be saved by it oh- oh- oh-


Cause you are stuck in darkness

You can't find the light you need

And here's the light oh- oh- oh-

You're gonna be saved by it oh- oh- oh-
