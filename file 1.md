Fireworks by Katy Perry (lyrics edit)

Do you ever feel just like a piece of trash

Drifting trough your life

Wanting to change it all


Do you ever feel there's no point in life

Like a house of sticks

One blow from collapsing
(To me, this line doesnt match the tune if you were to hum it, so maybe...can say
Do you ever feel, feel that life's so bleak
everything is grey
not a single hue)


Do you ever feel like no one understands

All you say and do

No one gets a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you

There's still hope in you


You just have to find your hope

And brighten up

Just find the one

That can light up your life


Cause you are stuck in darkness

You can't find the light you need

And here's the light oh- oh- oh-

You're gonna be saved by it oh- oh- oh-
